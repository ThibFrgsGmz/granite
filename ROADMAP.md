### How should I use this document?

This document provides a description of the elements on which the project has decided to focus and a high-level roadmap for its development .

This document should be used to help determine whether a contribution might conflict with some long-term plans.

The fact that a feature does not appear in this list does not mean that a patch for that feature will automatically be denied.
We are always happy to receive patches for new features that we have not thought of or prioritized. Please understand, however, that it may take longer to review these patches.
